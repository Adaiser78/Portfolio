          <h3>Programming</h3>
<p style = "margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0;"> Writing code for the past 3 years has been an absolute delight. I mainly program using Python and HTML.
   I am the President of my school's Computer Science Club where I teach my peers about the fundamentals of programming and guide them in projects.
   Here's a picture of me discussing Python programming to some club members.

<h3>Volleyball</h3>
        Having suffered more than 10 sprains, I can say that I have dedicated alot towards Volleyball. Here is my favorite pic of me playing.
        Although I it stands out to me because it was the final game of a tournmanet, I
        find it especailly memorable because I sprained my leg seconds after that picture was taken.

  <h3>Robotics</h3>
<p>I cannot even count the times I have accidentally electrocuted myself trying to construct
  a small robotic car, but I can tell you that it's alot. Most of my
builds have looked very similar to the one in this picture.</p>

  <h3>Psychology</h3>
<p>Psychology started out for me when I read a book, which I do not recall the name of, about social interactions within human society .
  Since then, I have read countless books about Human Psychology
  in an effort to understand myself and others around me better.</p>
